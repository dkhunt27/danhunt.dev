            we do. He takes on large pieces of work, sometimes entire features.
            Recently he spear headed the new iOffice feature, essentially single
            handed, while dealing with shifting requirements and slow to respond
            dependencies."

            "Dan has been a great mentor when I joined the team and continues to
            be so today. He's always patient and always open to give help, which
            I know can't be easy when he's juggling this with the large workload
            he always has on his plate. I know I've asked him the exact same
            question multiple times, but he never calls me out on it. Without
            skipping a beat he'll jump into re-explaining. He's great at going
            as deep as you need on a topic and gumping it down to where you need
            it to be as well."

            cutting edge in general. Lately the fireside chat channel has been
            the "Dan's Discoveries" channel. These finds often lead to sizable
            wins, like far faster deploy times. One such win was implementing
            AWS vault in our deployment process to further protect our AWS
            credentials on our local computers. These "inches" add up to miles
            over time and are a huge reason why we are as successful a team as
            we are."

            repaired features, sometimes late at night in his spare time. The
            story board isn't always enough of an indicator on how much he does.
            Beyond just TLM, Dan takes on multiple stories every sprint with
            ease, often the hardest ones on the board."
